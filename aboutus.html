            As we know that Art is a technique to express some
            certain emotions to bind ourselves in the root. If we go back five thousand or more than five thousand,
            we find that Art had an integral role not only in
            expressing emotions or ideas but the development of
            the mankind. There are lots of painting which we
            have found on the walls of ancient caves or
            milestones which directly give the clues that tribal
            communities painted the paintings whether on the
            walls or milestones to keep them safe for next
            generation. We know that Art does not fulfill some
            our basic needs but Art through painting or
            photography, we preserve them for the future and
            remember those days which we had spent beautiful
            moments with our family or friends. When we look at
            painting, photograph on the walls, feel happy.
            Arts have several forms such as performing or visual
            arts, visual arts consist of drawing, painting,
            architecture and photography, on the other hand
            performing arts consist of opera, music, dance,
            theatre, circus etc.
